# AndroidStudyAppForOOP-Memory-Storage
A multiple choice quiz Android app built in Android Studio for personal use. Topics now include object-oriented programming, memory and other computer storage related items.

I'm still editing the app and in the process of getting approved by Google to put on Play Store.

# Next Steps:
Currently, I'm only using the app to test myself on topics I'm interested in. I intend to add different categorical questions and other features soon.

Screenshots so far:
